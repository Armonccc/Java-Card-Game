# Java-Card-Game 
A simple GUI-based card game built with Java Swing where you play against the computer. The goal is to get as close to 33 points as possible without going over.

**How to Play**

Each player can Reveal a Card or Skip a turn.

Revealed cards add to your score.

The computer may choose to reveal or keep its card hidden.

The game ends when:

5 rounds have been played (highest score ≤ 33 wins).

A popup announces the winner and gives you the option to play again.
